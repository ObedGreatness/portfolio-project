## Portfolio Project: Weather App

### Tagline: Research and Project Approval

### Team Member(s): Obed Yawson Akpah

Role: Responsible for overseeing the overall project, creating the application from scratch to finish, settling timelines, and ensuring the project stays on track.

### Technologies:

- Languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Alternatives: Node.js

### Challenge Statement:
  The portfolio project is thereby a weather app created to provide users with up-to-date and accurate information about current and forecasted weather conditions. Weather apps typically offer features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation chances, and forecasts for the upcoming hours, days, or even weeks. The portfolio project, which is the weather app ,  won't solve the underlying causes of weather phenomena themselves. While they provide valuable information to help individuals navigate and plan around weather conditions, they don't address the root causes such as climate change, atmospheric disturbances, or other factors influencing weather patterns. The portfolio project , which is the weather app will help the general public ie. everybody including farmers,travellers, Outdoor Enthusiasts, event planners, construction and maintenance workers , agriculturists and so on .The project can be relevant and useful for specific locales, but they can also provide value to users regardless of their location such as the local relevances,global coverages etc.

## RISKS:  
           
             Technical Risks: 
                               
Weather data needs to be accurate and reliable to provide users with useful information. Inaccurate data can lead to user dissatisfaction.
Many weather APIs have rate limits and usage quotas. Exceeding these limits can result in additional costs or temporary suspension of service.
Integrating and parsing data from APIs can be complex, especially when dealing with different data formats (JSON, XML).
Designing an intuitive and attractive user interface (UI) is crucial. Poor UI can lead to a bad user experience (UX), even if the app functions correctly.
High traffic or inefficient code can lead to performance issues, slow load times, and poor user experience.
Weather apps that involve user data (e.g., location) need to ensure that this data is handled securely to prevent leaks and unauthorised access. 
Ensuring the app works across multiple platforms (iOS, Android, web) can be challenging due to differences in operating systems and browsers.
Users from different regions may require the app to be localised to their language and units of measurement (e.g., Celsius vs. Fahrenheit).
Relying on third-party services (e.g., weather APIs, map services) can be risky if these services experience downtime or policy changes.
Misuse of API data or non-compliance with terms of service can lead to legal issues.

Potential impacts:
      Here are some of the potential impacts;                          
User Dissatisfaction: Inaccurate weather data can lead to a loss of trust and users abandoning the app.

Unexpected Costs: Unplanned costs from exceeding API usage quotas can strain project resources.
App Crashes: Poor data parsing can cause app crashes or incorrect data display.
User Frustration: Users encountering errors or inconsistencies may stop using the app. etc.
Safeguards/Alternatives: 
Here are some of the safeguards/alternatives;
Regular Updates: Ensure data is updated frequently to maintain accuracy.
User Feedback: Enable users to report inaccuracies to improve data quality over time.
Local Sensors: Integrate with local weather stations or sensors for more precise data.
API Alternatives: Use multiple APIs with different rate limits and quotas.
